I actually really enjoyed this paper by Alfie Kohn on the “The case against grades”. Last semester was the first when I took online classes. I’m not very comfortable 
with online classes for some reasons. I had some issues with an assignment and assumed I would receive a bad grade but it did not jeopardize my chances of receiving
a decent mark in that course, as I worked really hard during the semester. Anyway, It was a fantastic course, and I received a decent mark as a result.

Grades represent your understanding of a particular subject or course. Good grade shows that you’re successful in a subject while low grade shows that you need to 
improve yourself. At times grades help in discovering you’re interest level in a particular course. While grades are important it shouldn’t be considered as measure
to intelligence or expertise level because some students just have a good memory power. All they do is memorize stuff and put in on a paper during exams. Coming to 
my experience with grades has been good so far. I do all the required work in class and complete assignments on time which successively help me get good grades in 
exams. 

Everyone is aware of the significance of grades. We can easily see where we stand in a class or on a particular subject. We feel less stressed if grades were removed 
but grades serve as metrics in many areas such as colleges look at the GPA while considering students at the time of admission or companies look for a minimum GPA 
during the hiring process. These reasons would be my motivation in case grades were removed from courses.

In my opinion there is no easy way out to complete assignments other than copying and pasting from internet but to reduce the stress and burden I think an easy way 
out to complete assignments would be to team up with a friend or classmate. There was time when I had too much on my plate and the deadline was near so I asked one 
of my classmates if he was willing to work with me. So we setup a time to meetup and discuss our ideas, methods. We would also explain stuff to each other which 
made learning new topics much easier. This is one easy way out for assignments I follow when needed.
